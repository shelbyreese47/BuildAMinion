**Identify the Problem**
- What exactly are we trying to solve?
- What are we delivering?

**Conceptualize the solution**
- Look at the big picture
- Avoid details
- Whiteboards and pen-and-paper can be useful tools here

**Break It Down**
- Break the conceptual models down into concrete steps / actionable items
- Identify risks (e.g., gaps in knowledge and technology)
