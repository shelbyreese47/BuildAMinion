**Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome**

***Major Hurdles***
- How to use flexbox to style the page how I wanted it
- How to solve discrepancies in the branches
- 

***Unsolved Problems***
- Mobile compatability! My game will look great on one phone, but awful on a different phone! 
    - It also looks great on the chrome 'iphone' but not on my actual iphone
- Styling! 
    - The empty boxes aren't centered on the screen- they're centered on the div
        - I know I can make the div 100vw to solve this, but then the mobile compatability really messes up
    - The boxes next to Level 01 will not line up with the lower level boxes!
